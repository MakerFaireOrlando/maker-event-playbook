## Maker Faire Orlando
[Maker Faire Orlando](https://www.makerfaireorlando.com) is a multi-day Maker Faire taking place in Orlando, FL.  In 2019, Maker Faire Orlando welcomed more than 16,000 participants and well over 300 exhibits.  The event typically happens on a Saturday and Sunday, indoor and outdoor elements.

## The Playbook for Maker Faire Orlando
This playbook is used document and organize the event so that we can provide an amazing experience for all our stakeholders including makers, volunteers, attendee, crew, sponsors. Over time, it will contain documentation for all the major areas of the Faire including our work with makers, volunteers, sponsors and others, hands-on activities, Robot Ruckus, Power Racing and more.

"We've had some amazing successes, and some spectacular failures in our 8 years of producing Maker Faire Orlando. This playbook captures the best and the worst so that we can learn, continue to improve, and continually grow our crew making the event more enjoyable for everyone involved." - Ian Cole, The Maker Effect Foundation

## Current Status
We are part of the team launching the Maker Event Playbook at the Nation of Makers conference in June 2020. We've built this shell site to share the vision, and will be turning our attention to collecting the points and authoring the content on these pages.

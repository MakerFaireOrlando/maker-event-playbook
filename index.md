## Maker Event Types
Maker events come in all shapes & sizes - so we've separated this guide into three event sizes to help you learn from other events that are similar in scope and size to your planned event.

### 1. Large Maker Events
This [event guide](event_type_large.html) is for events with hundreds of makers / maker exhibits and thousands of attendees. Most commonly this is a multi-day Maker Faire or Maker Festival type of event.

###  2. Medium Maker Events
This [event guide](event_type_medium.html) is for events with dozens of makers / maker exhibits and hundreds of attendees
Most commonly this is a single-day Maker Faire or Maker Festival type of event.

### 3. Small Maker Events
This [event guide](event_type_small.html) is for events with a few makers and dozens of attendees. Most commonly this is a makerspace event.

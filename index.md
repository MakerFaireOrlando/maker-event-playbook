# The Playbook for Maker Faire Orlando
Maker Faire Orlando is a multi-day Maker Faire taking place in Orlando, FL.  This event regularly sees 10,000+ participants and well over 300 exhibits.  It typically happens on a Saturday and Sunday, every year it has had indoor and outdoor elements.  This playbook is to be used to help document and organize the event for future use and tracking.

# About The Maker Event Playbook Project
The Maker Event Playbook is a project of [Nation of Makers](https://www.nationofmakers.us), and will be maintained long-term by the Nation of Makers community. The project's initiation can be traced back to the maker event organizer track at [NOMCON](https://www.nomcon.org) 2019 (the Nation of Makers annual conference) with a workshop that led to several calls to action from the attendees, one of which was to create a community-driven playbook for maker events. This led to a proof of concept with GitHub Pages in the summer of 2019, and the creation of a [project team](/contribute/collaborators) in the fall of 2019 and the goal of launching the early draft of the playbook and opening up the playbook for contributors at NOMCON2020.

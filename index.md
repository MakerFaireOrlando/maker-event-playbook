## Maker Event Guides
Maker events come in all shapes & sizes - so we've separated this playbook into three guides by event type to help you learn from other events that are similar in scope to your planned event.

### Maker Socials
[Social events](makers_socializing.html) are not specifically about making things, but serve as a way to build and strengthen the Maker Community. Often itâ€™s about connecting and sharing with other makers in a social setting. These may be networing events, or considered gatherings or relationship building.

* Socials (includes parties)
* Meetups / Maker Meetups
* Festivals
* Game Night
* Birthday Party
* Field Trips (visiting other places)
* Event (that someone else is putting on)
* Maker Conference (Speakers/Presentations/Ignite/BarCamp)
    * Seeing a Show / Talk (Mythbusters Live, TEDx Talk, etc.)

###  Makers in the Community
Bringing the passion for [making out into the world and sharing it](makers_going_into_community.html) with others is an important aspect of the Maker Community. This might include making or sharing at an event that someone else is organizing and hosting but you are just taking part in.

* Outreach (Going to do hands-on activities at other events)
* Building Competitions
* PPPRS Event
* Maker Camps (kid-based)
* Workshops for kids
* Make and Takes
* Maker Meetups (including meetups around Faires like Bring-a-Hack)
* Community Build (Magic Wheelchair/Art/Shared Project)
* All of these have a supply list or physical things?

Social events are not specifically about making things, but serve as a way to build and strengthen the Maker Community. Often it's about connecting and sharing with other makers in a social setting. These may be considered networing events, gatherings, or relationship building opportunities.

## Socials

If you've ever got together with a group of makers but didn't neceesarily _make_ anything, perhaps you were at a **Maker Social** event. These may be networking events, or maker dinners, or just getting together with friends (who happen to be makers) to hang out, perhaps discuss making, and hopefully get inspired. Every now and then a makerspace will throw a party and invite people to check out their space, and provide food, drink, and sometimes entertainment. Parties are fun events where you get to meet new makers and see their space.

##  Meetups / Maker Meetups

Meetups (and specifically, **Maker Meetups**) tend to be organized public events where anyone and everyone who is interested in the topic (Making, in this case) is invited to take part. Meetups can be formal, or informal, and may include talks or presentations, or may lean towards being more social. Meetup topics run the gamut, and many groups who are trying to start a makerspace start the process by running a Maker Meetup.

## Festivals

Festivals come in all shapes and sizes, and some of them are of particular interest to the Maker Community. Fringe Festival immediately comes to mind as we've seen makers, artists, and other creatives from the Maker Community attend the events, and sometimes even get involved showing their work. Burning Man might be considered a festival, though it's a bit more than a local event you might check out on a typical weekend.

## Game Nights

We've seen Game Nights happen at makerspaces where the focus is on spending time with your fellow makers just playing and having a good time. It might be board games or video games, but again, the focus is more of a social event than hands-on making, though there's a chance some maker will want to show off the board game accessories or DIY gaming cabinet they buit.

## Birthday Parties

Even makers have birthdays! We've seem maker themed birthday parties for kids and adults. Imagine a typical birthday party buy mix in some DIY, hands-on activities where everyone gets to make something.

## Field Trips

If you are a member of a makerspace, or wish you were a member of a makerspace, you might find it very interesting to visit other spaces. The best time to visit another makerspace is during their specific open hours when they'll (typically) have people available to give you a tour and talk about their space. Plan a trip to another makerspace with your friends and learn how others do their making!

Field Trips might also be to places that are _not_ makerspaces. Museums, art galleries, rapid prototyping labs, universities. We even heard from one makerspace that the put togther a field trip to Fermilab, the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, Illinois. If you're going to go on a field trip, bring some makers with you.

## Event (Attending)

While much of this guide is about putting on Maker Events, there's always visiting another event that you are _not_ organizing. If you're an event producer, one of the most relaxing things you can do is go to another event where _someone else_ is organizing everything. 

## Maker Conferences

There are all sorts of conferences and events of interest to the Maker Community. Grassroots events likes BarCamps, Ignite Talks, as well as tradeshows like IMTS (International Manufacturing Technology Show) have topics and presentations that many makers would enjoy.

## Seeing a Show

Sometimes you just want to hang out with other makers and be entertained and/or informed (or both)! We all loved MythBusters (Hi Adam!) and after the show ended Jamie and Adam did tours with live shows. TEDx Talks are TED-style events that take place anywhere and everywhere, and celebrate locally-driven ideas. (We've even seen makers giving TEDx Talks.) Plenty of other shows and talks lean into the areas of interest to makers, in fact we know of at least one makerspace that has an open invitation to Nick Offerman to visit when he's in town for one of his shows.

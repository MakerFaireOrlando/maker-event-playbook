## Overview
Maker Check In should be in a 10x10 tent outside the main gate entry with obvious signage making it easy for makers and maker helpers to find.
This is the first in person experience for most makers, so volunteers must be courteous, patient, and handle stress well.
Makers get their check in packet with event information as well as their credentials.
They should have reported their number of helpers online, so the packets should be complete, but the default is 3 helpers per maker.
The maker check in coordinator can make helper corrections within these guidelines as needed without contacting the gate captain or a producer.

## Problem Solving
Makers are often in a hurry and have lots of questions. When someone is causing a bottleneck, pull them to the side so other volunteers can keep the check in line moving.

## Robot Ruckus Competitor Check-in
Robot Ruckus competitors will have a separate adjacent check in tent following the same process as maker check in. Keeping these lines separated has proven to streamline the process and allow everyone to get checked in so they can unload.

## Once the Event Opens to the Public
Maker Check In will be converted to an information station after the event opens. If space availability allows, it can be relocated to just inside the venue or an area more convenient for guests.

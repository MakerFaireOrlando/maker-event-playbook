summary: Maker Check-in is an important welcome experience for makers.
---

## Overview
Maker Check In should be in a 10x10 tent outside the main gate entry with obvious signage making it easy for makers and maker helpers to find.
This is the first in person experience for most makers, so volunteers must be courteous, patient, and handle stress well.
Makers get their check in packet with event information as well as their credentials.
They should have reported their number of helpers online, so the packets should be complete, but the default is 3 helpers per maker.
The maker check in coordinator can make helper corrections within these guidelines as needed without contacting the gate captain or a producer.

## Maker Packets

Each EXHIBIT receives a packet (but we call it a maker packet anyway) that is a manilla envelope with the items they need for the weekend.

### Making labels
Used 2 exports- Approved for Mailchimp and maker check in export

Filtered maker check in for [year] only
sorted both by Exhibit ID
Add Location from Mail Chimp to Check In Export
Clean Up unneeded Columns
Mail Merge from Combined File.

CAN BE MADE  A SINGLE FILE IF WE ADD HELPER COUNT TO MAIL CHIMP EXPORT OR SPACE TO CHECK IN EXPORT.

(Ian's note - did we make this improvement yet?)

## Problem Solving
Makers are often in a hurry and have lots of questions. When someone is causing a bottleneck, pull them to the side so other volunteers can keep the check in line moving.

## Robot Ruckus Competitor Check-in
Robot Ruckus competitors will have a separate adjacent check in tent following the same process as maker check in. Keeping these lines separated has proven to streamline the process and allow everyone to get checked in so they can unload.

## Once the Event Opens to the Public
Maker Check In will be converted to an information station after the event opens. If space availability allows, it can be relocated to just inside the venue or an area more convenient for guests.

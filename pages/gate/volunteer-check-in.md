## Overview
The volunteer check in tent will be open throughout the entire event as volunteers will be checking in and out at various times during setup, open hours, and break down.

Volunteers preregister for their position and shift and are asked to check in 30 minutes prior to their shift time. This allows them time for a quick orientation and to learn the layout of the event. Guests will see the volunteer shirt and ask them questions, so make sure your volunteers know how to answer basic questions or where to find the answers they do not know.
The volunteer coordinator tracks who needs volunteers at any given time. It is unavoidable that some will not show up and others will show up having not preregistered. The volunteer coordinator can register them on site at their discretion keeping in mind age and supervision requirements of youth volunteers.

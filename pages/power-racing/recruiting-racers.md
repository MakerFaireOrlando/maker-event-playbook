## Outreach Events
Taking cars out to different events into the community is one of the quickest and easiest ways to get people excited about joining up.  Seeing how cool, complicated, (or uncomplicated) and fun these cars can be.

### Rides
Depending on your car, what event, etc.  sometimes you can let someone drive the car around.  Feeling the power and handling, and just general silliness of a Power Wheels Racer can get people wanting to participate.

## Workshops
Hosting a workshop day is a great way to get into the nitty gritty of how to build a car.  We have hosted a few workshops in the past years typically getting one or two cars out of each session.  This is a great way to get into the rules with prospective builders plus the detailed resources that are out there.

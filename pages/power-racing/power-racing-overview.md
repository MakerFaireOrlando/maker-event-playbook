summary: Power Racing at MakerFaire involves setting up a track as well as the pits. If the event is an official Power Racing event, the Power Racing organization needs to be involved and will also include the timing and associated electronic infrastructure.

## Resources Needed

### Local resources
* Track design
* Rental or purchase of track barriers. The track barriers must be able to protect the spectators by preventing a car from accidentally entering the spectator areas
* Some type of barriers between the pits and the spectators. These can be as simple as bike rack sections. There are electrical as well as mechanical hazards in the pits so it is best to keep the spectators out of the pits
* Tent for the pits area. This keeps the sun/rain off the teams as they work on their cars. This could be individual pop-up tents or a single long one that extends over all pit locations
* Tent for timing/scoring area
* Tables and chairs for each pit. This provides a workbench as well as places to sit
* Signage
* Power for pits areas. Teams will need power
* Power for timing/scoring area
* Welding area. If possible a welding area with appropriate power and visual site protection is nice to have
* Fire Extinguishers
* Trash disposal containers
* Medals if desired. If an official event, the Power Racing organization typically provides them, see below
* Structure to support timing electronics (If an official Power Racing event)
* PA/Sound system
* Moxie board
* Race schedule for publishing


### External resources (Official Power Racing Series event)
* Notification of event to Power Racing organization
* Coordination of Power Racing representatives
* Travel and lodging expenses for Power Racing representatives
* Car transponders and associated electronics (provided by Power Racing organization)
* Medals (typically provided by Power Racing organization)

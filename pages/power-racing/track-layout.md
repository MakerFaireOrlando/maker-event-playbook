## Barriers
PRS cars weigh usually around 100lbs empty.  Put a human into it and fling it around at 15mph there is a good amount of energy.  You don't want that energy being transferred into the shins of your event attendees.  So the number one priority of a PRS track is to keep non-racers out.  In Orlando we own several hundred plastic totes, these get [filled with water, and lined with wood.](https://flic.kr/p/2hMJr6T)  Water for weight and stopping power, wood to help them not brake when a car hits it.  In the past we rented (at considerable cost) [water filled jersey barriers.](https://flic.kr/p/PNNRKV)  These were very effective in containing crowd and racers, but being tall made the races less visually appealing.  Also we they were a considerable cost.

### Timing Truss
[The timing system is based on infrared](http://www.rclapcounter.com/page1/page1.html) emitters on each car, and receivers overhead.  We use a stage truss setup to get the receivers overhead, while providing a great visual for racers and audience of where the start/finish line is.

## Pits
Each team will need a pit space to work on, charge, and store their cars.  We try to give a 10x10 space with a folding table.  Each team will need access to power to charge batteries and power tools.  The pits should be on a lane such that cars can safely exit the racing circuit, get in and out of their respective pit, and back onto the track safely.

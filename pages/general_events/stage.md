## Stage Manager
Each stage will need a stage manager, this volunteer has to wear many hats.  The tasks include, but are not limited to; coordinating the tech team with performers,  finding lost performers, helping load and unload acts, introducing acts on the microphone...  Because this person is vital in the smooth operation of the stage, its an important volunteer role to find someone with some experience in theatre or live events.

Hopefully your awesome stage manager is involved with the scheduling and communication with the performers and acts.  If not, someone will need to be.

## Seating
Provide a place for the audience to sit and enjoy the programming on stage.  They may just want to take a load off and learn of their new favorite local artist by just sitting and listening during MFO.  Options are loose chairs, bleachers, or benches.  In the past we have used all of these options for our temporary stage.

## Indoor Stage
We have varied from year to year with an indoor stage or not.  Depending on what special events we might have or what resources we have.  Typically we have rented a temporary indoor stage from Complete Production Resources in Orlando.  They provide setup and strike labor.  They also provide pipe and drape used as a backdrop for the stage.  If needed we can get audio and video production elements from them as part of the package.
We typically do a 24" riser, with stairs leading up.  If there is heavy equipment rolling on and off stage they can provide a basic ramp.  The stage has a skirt going around which is velcroed on.  Since this stage is rented, some care is taken to be sure it will not be damaged.

### Lighting
Since the indoor stage is, indoors, we provide theatrical lighting from a local sponsored production partner.  Typically two 16' crank stands with truss are set out in the audience.  This truss will have an array of LED lighting devices on it to both light the stage and some ambient light for the audience.  It is controlled via DMX on a console offstage.  Depending on the needs of the performer the lighting can change drastically between acts or even during the act.

### Audio
Much like the lighting system, with the variety of acts the needs for these acts with microphones, playback, instruments, etc. change from performer to performer.  Typically we use small floor mounted point sources, trying to not have the noise project to the back of the venue, as those are booths.  We try and have wireless mics for ease, but wired mics may be necessary due to demand.

### Video
We have had requests for screens before, hang a projector and use the screen.  Just depends on what acts you have.

## Outdoor Stage
Occasionally we rent an outdoor portable stage from The City of Orlando Parks and Recreation Department.  This stage has to be on concrete or asphalt, as it is a rolling trailer that pulls in and gets parked. It is purely a stage with a roof.

### Audio
We use a very similar system to what is used indoors, outdoors.  We will use something with a little more power as outside requires it.  Typically we have a full time DJ on this stage providing ambiance. In 2019 we did not have an outdoor stage, and setup the DJ at the entrance to the fairgrounds under a tent.

### Power Racing
Power Racing is another outdoor venue that has an audio system we provide.  They need one or two microphones and a connection for a laptop.  They will play some music and have announcers before and during races.

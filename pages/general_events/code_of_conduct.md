summary: Having a Code of Conduct for your event...
---


Many events have a Code of Conduct, which is a set of guidelines and rules about behavior of participants during the event. A Code of Conduct serves to create an inclusive culture, and leadership of an event should adhere strongly to the Code of Conduct and serve as an example for others.It’s worth noting that a Code of Conduct must be learned over time, and you cannot expect everyone to immediately adhere to it. It will be a process, and as such, require interaction between those who understand it, and those who are in the process of understanding it. Not everyone will agree with the guidelines and rules of your Code of Conduct, and you must decide what to do at that point. If violating the Code of Conduct is enough to get someone removed from your event, you must have a plan in place for that. As always, be polite, explain things clearly, and follow a plan. Do you provide a refund? Do you ban a Maker from taking part in future events? Do you have a “three strikes” rule? Determine as much as you can beforehand, but know that you might not get it right the first time. Like everything else, it’s an iterative process where the goal is to continually improve.

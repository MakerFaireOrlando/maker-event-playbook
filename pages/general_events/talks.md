summary: Makers get up on a stage, or in a wing, and talk about stuff.

## Who talks?
At MFO in past years we have had everything from educators to artists give a talk on whatever it is they do.  We typically promote these heavily as they can draw in a crowd who wants to come learn something or see their favorite local maker share their story.

## Stage
On the stage we will coordinate with the overall event for the speaker, find out any AV needs and other requirements for the talk.  Some venues allow for a nice quiet indoor space, some venues don't have that nicety.

## Meeting room
Sometimes we can get a meeting room to hold these talks in.  Sometimes we make the room with pipe and drape.

## When do I need a licensing agreement?
When hosting an event, it is important to research your event name or key marketing phrase to make sure it is not trademarked by someone else. If so, you must get permission from the owner of the trademark in order to use it. 

For example, the name "Maker Faire" is owned by Maker Media. They allow communities to host their own branded Maker Faires with a licensing agreement. Local event organizers are required to contact Maker Media to understand rules and requirements for using that name for their event. 

Whether it is a Maker Faire, a combat robot event, or a miniature home made car racing event, understanding any required licensing could save you a tremendous amount of legal and financial challenges.

## Rule of thumb
If youâ€™ve randomly come up with an amazing catchy name for your event, do a quick google search. Someone else may have come up with that same amazing catchy name before.

Signage needs will typically scale with the size of your event. Running an event for a few hours at your makerspace? Chances are anyone coming through the door will know what is happening and where to go. Running a large multi-day, multi-building event? You're going to need more signage.

Signage serves two purposes, directs people _to_ you event (in the form of outdoor, sometimes off-site signage) and directs people _around_ your event (in the form of on-site signage.)

Signage to your event may include billboards, yard signs, and banners. Typically you'll need to work with the venue in regards to signage. Some venues have strict policies about what can be placed where, and may even need to approve artwork and verbiage.

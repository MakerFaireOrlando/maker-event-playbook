summary: If the public doesn't know its happening, then we are missing a big point!

## Marketing
If there is a big act coming to perform at MFO, we want to have thier schedule setup in advance, it may even be part of a contract.  This schedule should be added to marketing material, if someone is driving 5 hours to see a giant tesla coil, let them know its happening 3 times a day, or if its just once, tell them when!

## Its a whole event
Sometimes you need to take the performance schedule into account with other goings on at the event.  If there's a big loud music act going on outside at the same time a PRS race is going on also being loud, there will be conflict both aurally and in the plans of attendees who might want to be both places at once.  If you are having panels, make sure that if those people are competing in an event during MFO, it doesn't step on toes.

## For the public
The most dynamic schedule we have available to the public is online, and in turn through the app.  We also deploy digital signage throughout the venues, if the schedule needs to change, get with whomever has access to those signs and keep them up to date.

## For performers
Well before the event the general schedule for the performers needs to be set.  Many acts come in specifically for their performance, they might have other gigs or whatever reason cannot just hangout all day waiting for their slot.  So be clear with the performers when their time is, and adjust as needed if it doesn't fit their schedule.  Make sure performers are at the stage early enough to get setup (at least 15 mins typically) and get any AVL needs from them ahead of time.

## Who performs?
We have had a large variety of performers over the years, from tesla coils to operatic powerhouses.  It really just varies as to who you can recruit that year!

## Stage
Every performer is going to need microphones at some point.  Depending on the act it could be one mic or 10, just have to be ready.  Same issues on both indoor and outdoor stage.  For music acts there might be backing tracks that need to get queued up and played from off stage.

## Pop Up
Some may call it a flashmob, or a pop up performance.  But sometimes the acts go out into the crowd, near or maybe completely separate from your designated performance space.  For instance the One Man Band, plays in the common space just randomly in-between buildings, or strolling opera singers might break out into song in the middle of the event.  Its fun and keep it that way!

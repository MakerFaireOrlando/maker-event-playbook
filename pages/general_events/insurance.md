This does NOT address general day to day liability insurance for your facility. The purpose of this is to address extra insurance needed for special events.

## Extra Insurance
If your event involves holding borrowed items for display (art or special maker projects, for example), those items may cause you to need extra insurance. This need varies greatly by event, area, value of items, and it is entirely up to the hosting organization and if you, as the event host, are comfortable taking on the risk of protecting someone else’s property, 

Some venues as well as some funders (grants, sponsors) may have special insurance requirements that you do not need to carry year round. So you may want to look into “event insurance”. Event insurance is liability insurance that covers you only during the event and setup/breakdown. It may also cover cancellation costs if you are required to cancel your event. Special event insurance goes above and beyond normal business operations and is only in effect for the duration of your event.

Make sure you understand what is covered and what is not. It likely will not cover property that does not belong to you unless you specify that up front, so make sure to include coverage for property belonging to others (or you can require that they have their own insurance and give you an insurance certificate listing you as an additional insured). 

## Alcohol Liability
It is also important to understand alcohol liability if you allow alcohol to be served or sold. In some areas, the liability lies with the organization serving, so if your food vendors are the ones serving, they are the ones with the liability. If your organization is serving it, your organization is liable. Hiring third party bartenders or caterers with their own alcohol liability policies is always a good idea.

## Questions?
If you have any questions, nonprofits are usually willing to help each other out, so do not be afraid to contact another nonprofit and ask for advice.

## Technology and Tools

Is it possible to run a Maker Event using no technology? Maybe, but we don’t want to try it! The good news is, tools have gotten easier to use, and cheaper, over the years. Chances are pretty good that Lead Producers will spend a good amount of time managing a large event by sitting in front of a laptop, or constantly on a phone or a radio. Much of the time spent with those tools is about communicating and keeping everything on schedule.

## Ask for Help

If you’re a Lead Producer and technology is just not your thing, that’s okay… like other things, _delegate_. Find someone who just “gets” technology, or already has experience with what you’ll be using. If you are using Eventbrite for ticketing, ask other event producers how they do it. Check out the Eventbrite Help Center and Eventbrite Support site. They are in the business of helping you make ticketing at your event smooth and painless, so lean on them as needed.

For some event technology there might not be as much support. If you are using open source software for your digital signage, there may not be timely support. If you purchase a set of radios, there might not be support. For some technology support, you’ll either need to find team members who know a specific technology, or aren’t afraid to learn it. For smaller events, you might be completely responsible for everything, but typically smaller events mean less things to handle as far as scope, attendance, hours, etc.

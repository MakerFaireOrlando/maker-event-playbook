# maker-event-playbook
An open playbook for Maker events - https://nationofmakers.github.io/maker-event-playbook/

Concept: We intend to create a playbook for maker events, starting with the documentation of a large, two-day Maker Faire. 
We will create a taxonomy for maker events, and allow events to add their own documentation into the structure.

At this time, this is a prototype being created by Ian Cole - ian.cole@themakereffect.org. If you'd like to contribute, email Ian, we are not ready for pull requests.

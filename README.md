# maker-event-playbook
An open playbook for Maker events

Concept: We intend to create a playbook for maker events, starting with the documentation of a large, two-day Maker Faire. 
We will create a taxonomy for maker events, and allow events to add their own documentation into the structure.

At this time, this is a prototype being created by Ian Cole - ian.cole@themakereffect.org, and is not open for pull requests.
